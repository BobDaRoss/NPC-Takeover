# NPC-Takeover
Torch Plugin


Description:
This plugin fixes one of my most hated issues with SE and servers

As a server Admin i often find players capture npc grids and take block ownership of the entire grid yet authorship doesnt get transfered too.
So with our ingame server PCU limits players can abuse npc grids and capture hundreds of grids without actually takin authorship of the grid.
 
This plugin checks all control blocks on a give npc grid to make sure when a player grinds/takes owner the authorship transfers too. 
If they are over PCU limits, it will track the grid until the player logouts. It will then be deleted.
 
I never really found a mod or plugin to do this so I wrote my own
Whats future features do i have in mind:
 - Option to completley take block ownership too. Not just authorship
 - Add commands to check what control blocks are left on the grid to grind down to claim ownerships
 - Im sure ill think of more too (These just came from my other admin friends)
